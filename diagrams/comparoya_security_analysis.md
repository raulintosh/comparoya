# Comparoya Security Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the Comparoya application using SSP (System Security Plan) and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) methodologies.

## 1. System Overview

Comparoya is an Elixir/Phoenix web application that:
- Authenticates users via Google OAuth
- Has an admin authentication system with username/password
- Processes XML invoices from Gmail attachments
- Stores data in PostgreSQL
- Uses S3-compatible storage (DigitalOcean Spaces)
- Runs background jobs with Oban
- Is containerized with Docker

## 2. SSP (System Security Plan) Analysis

### 2.1 System Categorization

| Category | Impact Level | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Confidentiality | Moderate | The system processes invoice data which may contain sensitive business information |
| Integrity | High | Data integrity is critical for financial records and invoices |
| Availability | Moderate | System downtime would impact users but is not life-critical |

### 2.2 System Boundaries

The Comparoya application consists of:
- Web application (Phoenix)
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Storage (DigitalOcean Spaces)
- External API integrations (Gmail API)
- Background job processing (Oban, Quantum)

## 3. OWASP Top 10 Analysis

### 3.1 A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

**Assessment**: Partially Vulnerable

**Findings**:
- The application implements basic role-based access control with user and admin roles
- The `require_authenticated_user`, `require_admin`, and `require_authenticated_user_or_admin` plugs provide route protection
- However, there's no fine-grained access control for specific resources
- No evidence of horizontal privilege escalation prevention

**Recommendations**:
- Implement resource-based access control
- Add ownership checks for user-specific resources
- Implement CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Add rate limiting for authentication attempts

### 3.2 A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

**Assessment**: Partially Vulnerable

**Findings**:
- Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt

- No explicit encryption for sensitive data at rest
- OAuth tokens and refresh tokens are stored in plaintext in the database

**Recommendations**:
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest, especially OAuth tokens and refresh tokens
- Implement database encryption
- Ensure proper SSL/TLS configuration with strong ciphers
- Add secure headers for all responses

### 3.3 A03:2021 – Injection

**Assessment**: Vulnerable

**Findings**:
- XML parsing is done using SweetXml without explicit input validation
- The application processes XML from external sources (Gmail attachments)
- No evidence of XML sanitization before processing
- Ecto queries appear to use parameterized queries, reducing SQL injection risk

**Recommendations**:
- Implement strict XML validation against a schema before processing

- Consider using a more secure XML parser with DTD disabling
- Implement content security policy

### 3.4 A04:2021 – Insecure Design

**Assessment**: Partially Vulnerable

**Findings**:
- The application has a clear separation of concerns
- Authentication flows follow standard practices
- Error handling could expose sensitive information
- No evidence of threat modeling or security-focused design

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct threat modeling for key features
- Implement secure defaults for all components
- Add rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Enhance error handling to avoid information disclosure

### 3.5 A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

**Assessment**: Potentially Vulnerable

**Findings**:
- Development configuration exposes sensitive database credentials
- Secret key base is hardcoded in development configuration
- No evidence of secure deployment practices
- Docker configuration follows some security practices

**Recommendations**:
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement secrets management solution
- Remove hardcoded credentials from configuration files
- Add security headers to all responses

### 3.6 A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**Assessment**: Potentially Vulnerable
